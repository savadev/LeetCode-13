### Notes

"To iterate is human, to recurse, divine."
Speaking of Programming, recursion is possibly one of the most challenging parts to be implemented especially when it comes with some data structures such as linked list.

### SQL Notes
UPDATE
```
UPDATE
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition
```
CASE
```
CASE [option: expression]
    WHEN condition_1 THEN result_1
    WHEN condition_N-1 THEN result_N-1
    ELSE result_N
END
```
